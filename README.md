## DriverPass Project Overview
The DriverPass project focused on designing a system for a company that offers driver training services. The client wanted a web-based system that would allow students to register, schedule driving lessons, and access training materials. The system also needed to support staff and administrators by managing instructors, vehicles, schedules, and user accounts. The goal was to move away from manual scheduling and create a more reliable, centralized solution.

## What I Did Well
One area I feel I did well in this project was translating the business requirements into a clear and structured system design. The requirements document helped keep the scope focused, and I consistently referenced it while creating UML diagrams and design decisions. This helped ensure the system addressed the client’s needs without overcomplicating the design.

## What I Would Improve
If I could revise one part of my work, I would spend more time expanding on exception handling in the system design. Scenarios such as scheduling conflicts, cancellations, or unavailable instructors could be described in more detail. Improving this area would make the design more realistic and better prepared for long-term maintenance.

## Interpreting User Needs
User needs were interpreted by considering how students, instructors, and administrators would interact with the system on a daily basis. Features like appointment scheduling, availability checks, and confirmation messages were designed around those workflows. Focusing on user needs is important because a system must be practical and intuitive to be effective.

## My Approach to Software Design
My approach to designing software starts with understanding the problem and breaking it into smaller, manageable parts. I rely on requirement analysis, UML diagrams, and process flows to visualize how the system should work. In future projects, I plan to continue using these techniques while placing additional focus on maintainability and system support.
